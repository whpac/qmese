# QMESE experiment tasks

In this repo, you'll find two tasks for today's QMESE classes:
- [Task A](task_A/README.md)
- [Task B](task_B/README.md)

Instructions for them are provided in the linked files.

## Rules
These tasks are provided to you as a part of an experiment which aims to assess how listening to
music affects your coding abilities. We are not interested whether it helps to use AI assistants
or to learn from tutorials, though. Therefore, please solve these task on your own.

All the information necessary to implement the algorithm are provided in respective files, so you
shouldn't look them up in the internet. In particular, please don't search for pseudocodes
or complete implementations.

You're allowed to use Python documentation in order to learn about its built-in functions.
